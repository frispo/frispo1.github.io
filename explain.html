    <h3>CORE PLAYS</h3>
    <br>
    <h4> <a target="_blank" target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/201939/stephen-curry"> Stephen Curry</a> (PG – GSW): $10,500 DraftKings, $10,300 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>Curry has scored at least 45 DraftKings points in all but one game, generating a 53-point average. That’s the sharpshooter we’ve become accustomed to, and it’s surprising he’s not $1,000 more on each site. Despite being limited in his last matchup with Phoenix, Curry collected 45 DK points in fewer than 30 minutes of play. Look for him to get closer to 40 minutes here.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.3vw;"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/1626167/myles-turner"> Myles Turner </a>(C – IND): $6,900 DraftKings, $7,100 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>The talented center has been tasked with a much bigger role in Indiana, stepping up in the absence of <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/players/domantas-sabonis.php"> Domantas Sabonis</a>. Doing so has skyrocketed his minutes, shot attempts and usage, with him scoring at least 38 fantasy points in three straight. He also had a 55-point masterpiece just a few weeks back, and these sites are clearly undervaluing his upside. Not to mention, Charlotte is surrendering the most fantasy points to opposing centers.</p>
</div>
<div class="fax3">
    <h3>CASH GAME CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <br>
    <h4> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/1628983/shai-gilgeous-alexander"> Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</a> (PG/SG – OKC): $9,400 DraftKings, $10,400 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>Gilgeous-Alexander gets lost in the mix playing in Oklahoma City, but he is one of the best players in the NBA. He has scored at least 53 DraftKings points in four of his last five games, generating a 52-point average this season. This is one of the few times we expect OKC to play a close game, and it’s not like we’re worried about this average Washington defense.</p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.3vw;"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/1626164/devin-booker"> Devin Booker </a> (SG – PHX): $9,200 DraftKings, $9,000 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>Booker is always a safe bet for 40 fantasy points, but that looks like his floor with <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/players/chris-paul.php"> Chris Paul</a> sidelined. Paul’s absence has forced Booker into a playmaking role, and he’s averaging 49 fantasy points per game in his last three outings. A game like that seems likely against Golden State, ranked 29th in points allowed this season. In their one matchup, Booker dropped 53 fantasy points in his second-best game of the year.</p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.3vw;"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/1629008/michael-porter-jr"> Michael Porter Jr.</a>(SF/PF – DEN): $5,900 DraftKings, $6,200 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>We couldn’t get too far without recommending some Nuggets. Denver will be without <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/players/nikola-jokic.php"> Nikola Jokic</a>, meaning his team needs to make up for his missing 25 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists per game. Porter will be happy to fire up more shots in his absence, averaging over 13 shots a game with “The Joker” in the lineup. We believe he’s in line for 15-25 shots here, which is fantastic since he’s got at least 31 DK points in three of his last four games.</p>

</div>
<div class="fax4">
    <h3>GPP TARGETS</h3>
    <br>
    <h4> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/1627750/jamal-murray"> Michael Porter Jr.</a>(SF/PF – DEN): $5,900 DraftKings, $6,200 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>Murray is included in the GPP section because of his volatility, but he’s the best per-dollar play on the board. With Jokic off the floor this season, Murray has an absurd 39 percent usage rate. His usage, shot attempts and ball-handling duties will blow up with Jokic out, and, he also appears to be getting into form, scoring at least 33 fantasy points in six of his last seven games. Not to mention, the Knicks own a 26th OPRK against opposing point guards.</p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.3vw;"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/202691/klay-thompson"> Klay Thompson</a> (SG/SF – GSW): $5,700 DraftKings, $5,500 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>Thompson has been volatile with his shot all year, but he is still one of the best shooters in the NBA. It’s strange to see him sitting below $6K, but we know he’ll be closer to $7K in no time. He’s showing flashes of doing just that, scoring at least 29 fantasy points in four of his last five games. That’s all he needs to be a good value, and we have to assume that’ll be his floor at some point this season.    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.3vw;"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/1630197/aleksej-pokusevski"> Aleksej Pokusevski</a>(PF – OKC): $5,300 DraftKings, $6,100 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>This versatile forward averaged 30 fantasy points per game in the final month of last season and is starting to play like that this year. He’s scored at least 23 DK points in six straight outings, dropping 38 or more fantasy points in half of those. That’s a ridiculous ceiling from such an affordable player, and he’s only scratching the surface of what he could become.</p>

</div>
<div class="fax5">
    <h3>VALUE PLAYS</h3>
    <br>
    <h4> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/201143/al-horford"> Al Horford </a> (PF/C – ATL): $5,700 DraftKings, $5,500 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>Horford has averaged nearly 40 fantasy points per game when <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/players/robert-williams-c.php"> Robert Williams </a>was out last season, and he’s slowly returning to that player now. He has scored at least 26 fantasy points in six straight outings, scoring 34 or more in four of those. You can’t ask for any more from a sub-$6K player, and Boston needs him to play big minutes to oppose <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/players/clint-capela.php"> Clint Capela</a>. That looks even better with Atlanta owning a 25th OPRK against opposing centers.</p>
     <h4 style="margin-top: 1.3vw;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/1628420/monte-morris"> Monte Morris</a> (PG/SG – WAS): $5,200 DraftKings, $5,300 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>We don’t think Morris will ever go off for 50 fantasy points, but he’s one of the safest bets to reach 5X value. The Wizards’ starting point guard is averaging more than 23 DraftKings points per game. He’s been even better recently, scoring at least 28 DK points in back-to-back games.   </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.3vw;"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nba.com/player/203486/mason-plumlee"> Mason Plumlee </a>(C – CHA): $5,900 DraftKings, $5,700 FanDuel</h4>
    <p>This versatile forward averaged 30 fantasy points per game in the final month of last season and is starting to play like that this year. He’s scored at least 23 DK points in six straight outings, dropping 38 or more fantasy points in half of those. That’s a ridiculous ceiling from such an affordable player, and he’s only scratching the surface of what he could become.</p>
